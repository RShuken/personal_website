        <p>I am an aspiring software developer who lives in Denver Colorado.</p>
        <p>In a past life I was a venture capitalist helping startups grow their dreams! I love project based learning
            and working in teams. My nick name in the past has been 'Soccer Mom' as I do my best to make sure everyone
            on my team is taken care of.</p>

                <h2>Some more about me.</h2>
                <p>I grew up in California and started coding when I was 12. I bought up all of the web domains in my
                    town and bought the book "HTML for Dummies" and taught myself how to build websites to sell.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I later in College studied economics but at night I would stay up late coding a website with a south
                    korean business partner that helped korean schools find english teachers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite following a path of finance, I am ready for the switch and I want to become a coder now! I
                    look forward to learning at thinkful get a job as a real developer and build fun projects at home
                    with my raspberry pi!</p>
